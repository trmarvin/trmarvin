## Hi hi 👋 I'm Tamar.

Lifelong internet nerd, finally decided to learn coding for real. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, React, Python, Node.js  
👩‍🎓 I have a Ph.D. in medieval & early modern Jewish studies, ask me what medieval manuscripts and webpages have in common (a lot!)  
🔭 I’m currently working on digital resources for Jewish learning  
⚡ Fun fact: my first handcoded webpage was about Walt Whitman anticipating modernism
