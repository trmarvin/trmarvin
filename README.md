## Hello World 👋 I'm Tamar.

Lifelong internet nerd, finally learned coding for real. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript, Next.js & PHP  
👩‍🎓 I have a Ph.D. in medieval & early modern Jewish studies, ask me what medieval manuscripts and webpages have in common (a lot!)  
🔭 I’m currently working on my dev portfolio, my scholarly website, and my family's hobby food blog  
💬 Ask me about learning and teaching programming from the perspective of a humanist-turned-technologist  
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on digital resources for Jewish learning  
⚡ Fun fact: my first handcoded webpage was about Walt Whitman anticipating modernism
